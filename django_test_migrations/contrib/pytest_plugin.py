    Why do we import :class:`Migrator` inside the fixture function?
    Otherwise, coverage won't work correctly during our internal tests.
    Why? Because modules in Python are singletons.
    Once imported, they will be stored in memory and reused.

    That's why we cannot import ``Migrator`` on a module level.
    Because it won't be caught be coverage later on.
